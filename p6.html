      <p>
        I was tasked to design and code a data portrait. The habit I tracked
        were my music listening habits, especially what genres/song I listened
        to at certain times of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        To read the data, the viewer must hover their mouse over each bar. When
        hovered, the bar will reveal the a notable song from that time period.
        If the person clicks on the canvas, time stamps will be revealed.
      </p>

        Design Process

      <p>
        The design and colors are inspired by abstract artist Mark Rothko. The
        square patterns I thought could naturally aign with a vertical timeline.

      <p>
        By translating the data into a coded pattern, I was able to notice what
        hours of the day I listened to music. It mostly aligns with the times I
        am commuting to and from the city. And, since I was also tracking music
        vaguely by genre, I noticed my sadder music would come out late at
        night.
      </p>

      <p>
        By tracking the data, I cannot deny I was a little nervous having my
        music taste on display. I feel like I was more hesitant to listen to my
        weirder music, since I wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to share it
        with others. Worries aside, I think this kind of project could be an
        awesome data visualizer for a streaming service or app.
