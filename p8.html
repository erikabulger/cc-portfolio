        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        My experimental camera makes bodily gestures necessary in capturing a discernable image. It is meant to explore 
        consent, as they must "pinch" in order to make themselves visible. 
      </p>
     <p>
       Each finger is assigned a different color, and those colors are randomly generated per session. When a certain finger is pinched, that color is then used. Both left and right hands can pinch at the same time to 
       use two different colors at the same time. Also, the size of the colored pixels change depending
       on where on the canvas the pinch commences. A pinch in the top-left corner will have the smallest size in comparison to a pinch in the bottom-right.
     </p>
     <p>
       The meaning that emerges from the experimental camera involves gestures. Video calls are often
       only meant to capture the shoulders up. In today's webcam-based communications,
       gestures have been replaced by emojis and typed comments. This is an exploration in ways our
       hands can have a purpose again in digital communication. This scenario specifically
       uses gestures in consent, or "allowing" the camera to capture you.
     </p>

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
      The following were my three design sketches:
     </p>
  <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/c557c303-c7ea-40bc-865c-c11d9e32a90e%2F1webcam.png?v=1636849898891"><img/>
     <p>
    The first idea was to have the webcam recognize a hand gesture and then present
       a textbook definition of that gesture. For example, the peace sign would be present a wordy
       excerpt from wikipedia,
       "The V sign is a hand gesture in which the index and middle fingers are raised and parted to make a V shape while the other fingers are clenched...
       in the 1960s, the "V sign" with palm outward was widely adopted by the counterculture as a symbol of peace..." etc etc. The description would be
       purposely verbose.
     </p>
  <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/c557c303-c7ea-40bc-865c-c11d9e32a90e%2Fwebcam2.png?v=1636850251194"><img/>
     <p>
       The second idea was similar to the first in it would recognize hand gestures.
       However, in this example, each hand gesture would correlate to a different filter.
     </p>
  <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/c557c303-c7ea-40bc-865c-c11d9e32a90e%2F3webcam.png?v=1636850780445"><img/>
  <p>
      The third option had each hand dictate the colors that are used on screen. If one hand is signalling a blue fill and the other hand is signalling a green fill, they 
    both would be present through the loaded pixels.
     </p>
     
       <p>
      My final concept is most similar with the third sketch, as it uses the finger pinching functionality that handsfree.js provides. I made
         the effect less clear as I enjoy more experimental and gritty visuals.
     </p>

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        Through this project, I learned how to use handsfree.js. I am using the functionality to assist
        me in my future projects, as I love the interactivity that hand tracking provides.
      </p>

      <p>
        My code provides a unique version of consentual webcam “seeing”. Usually,
        we are asked to click a button. Here, we must continue gesturing in order for our form to
        be captured.
