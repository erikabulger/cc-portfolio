        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        My sousveillence data criticizes the superficial process of identifying
        your disability status to an employer. When your mouse is on the left
        side of the canvas, the form is white with the usual text. When the
        mouse is moved to the left side, the form's text changes. If you click your mouse,
        real data populates the form from actual respondents to similar forms.
      </p>
      
        <p>
        I believe the collection of this data is very invasive, especially
        if its from mandatory forms like the Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability form. 
        Furthermore, the process feels superficial. Even if you disclose your 
        disability status, many employers and the
        government still fail to effectively address systemic and ableist
        barriers.
      </p>
      
      <h1>
        The Data
      </h1>
      <p>
        The data is sourced from the
        <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/"> CDC</a> API, specifically the Disability
        and Health Data System (DHDS). The used data set is titled
        <a
          href="https://data.cdc.gov/Disability-Health/DHDS-Prevalence-of-Disability-Status-and-Types-by-/qjg3-6acf"
        >
          Prevalence of Disability Status and Types by Demographic Groups,
          2019</a
        >, last updated May 26, 2021. It has 7,056 entries with the disability types:
        cognitive (serious difficulty concentrating, remembering or making
        decisions), hearing (serious difficulty hearing or deaf), mobility
        (serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs), vision (serious
        difficulty seeing), self-care (difficulty dressing or bathing) and
        independent living (difficulty doing errands alone). It also
        collects "identifier" data like age, race, location, and veteran status.

        Design Process

      <p>
        My initial ideas are sketched in the following storyboards:

      <p>
        I decided on the first idea since I personally have issues with the
        how corporate America collects disability data and then does nothing
        to support disabled workers with paid leave, useful disability benefits, etc.
        Also, by sectioning out the data by "profiles", it individualizes
        each entry in a way we don't often see in data gathering.
