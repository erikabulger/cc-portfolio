        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
       My experimental camera makes bodily gestures necessary in capturing a discernable image. It is meant to explore 
        consent, as they must "pinch" in order to make themselves visible. 
      </p>
     <p>
       My consentful interface better informs the user through an initial disclaimer screen, provides users the choice to turn on their webcam and the gesture tracking, and users
       are able 
       to retract their consent to webcam access + gesture tracking.
     </p>
      
    
     <h1>
        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
      The following is the pre-implementation flow chart sketch for my consentful interface:
     </p>
  <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/c557c303-c7ea-40bc-865c-c11d9e32a90e%2FFRIES%20flow%20chart.png?v=1637458892140"><img/>
    <p>
I "sketched" out the interface by writing out
     the information needed on the initial
     screen. Here is that sketch:</p>
     <img src="https://cdn.glitch.me/c557c303-c7ea-40bc-865c-c11d9e32a90e%2FScreen%20Shot%202021-11-20%20at%209.06.46%20PM.png?v=1637460516663"><img/>
     
       <p>
      The main necessary improvements that are now implemented:</p> 
        <p>1. A disclaimer page with a general description.  </p> 
         <p>2. Instructions on how to use Gesture Cam.</p> 
        <p>  3. More information on the extent of webcam access (that the image is not saved anywhere outside of the program
         without the user's consent).</p> 
         <p> 4. A linked video tutorial to give user's an idea of what will happen long before consenting to anything.</p> 
        <p>  5. The option to turn on the user's webcam rather than allowing the program to immediately access it.</p> 
      <p>    6. The option to turn on gesture tracking.</p> 
       <p>   7. The option to retract consent even if it had originally been given.
     </p>
     
      <h1>
        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
       I follow the F.R.I.E.S. model the following ways:
      </p>
     <p>
       Freely Given - The webcam is not immediately accessed and the gesture tracking must be manually turned on. 
       Consent is not forcefully given, as they are both options that must be 
       manually turned on within the interface.
      </p>
     <p>
       Reversible - Consent can be retracted within the running program even if it once had been given.
      </p>
     <p>
       Informed - The disclaimer page informs the viewer long before beginning the session on important details. There
       is also a tutorial video linked.
      </p>
     <p>
       Enthusiastic - Consent is not forcefully given. Users can see what Gesture Cam can do
       without giving webcam access by viewing the linked video. 
      </p>
     <p>
       Specific - The program specifically asks at each step to turn on certain functionalities (webcam access consent is seperate from
       gesture tracking consent). Consenting to webcam access does not necessarily mean the user
       would consent to gesture tracking. The program is specific and does not assume what the
       user is okay with.
     </p>

      <p>
        The consentful Gesture Cam recontextualizes user interaction and experience through the
        interface and functionality. Not only do you have to consent to webcam access
        for your image to be visible, but you also have to actively make a "pinching" motion.
        The program tries to inform the user as much as possible before they agree to anything.
        Furthermore, consent can be retracted, unlike many other programs.
  </p>
